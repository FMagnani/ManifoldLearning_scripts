# Some Manifold Learning scripts
Scripts used to embed Swissroll, MNIST and COIL20 datasets with Laplacian Eigenmap and UMAP, for a university course.  
  
This repository is designed for my personal usage.  
**Data** contains the raw data togheter with the processed data (for the most computationally intensive tasks I used Google Colab and then saved and downloaded the results). The Colab notebook files are present in the repo too.  
**mnist_coil20** contains the scripts to process the MNIST and COIL20 datasets and to plot the figures shown in its own sub-directory **Fig**.  
Guess what? The same applies to **swissroll**.
  
That's it. For further details on the Laplacian Eigenmap and UMAP algorithms reference my report or read the corresponding papers.
